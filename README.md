# Introduction

Hello and thank you for joining us for this intro to Web development with JavaScript workshop.

My name is Sarah Veness, your instructor today.

## Pair programming

You're encouraged to buddy up with one other person. That said, both of you should ideally do the setup work individually on your own laptops.

## The goal

Today's goal is to get acquainted with JavaScript-based Web programming by creating a simple chat application. We'll use modern tools \(Node.js, Web Sockets, etc.\) and touch upon many different technologies.

The objective is not to fully understand every line of code, but to understand server-client architecture and to be inspired by how much can be created with so little code.

## The product

The finished app that we'll be building in just a few hours today will look and feel much like this.
